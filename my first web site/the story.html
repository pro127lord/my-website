<p>Brenda never wanted to be famous. While most of her friends dreamed about being famous,
 she could see the negative aspects that those who wanted to be famous seemed to ignore.
 The fact that you could never do anything in public without being mobbed and the 
complete lack of privacy was something that she never wanted to experience. 
She also had no desire to have strangers speculating about every aspect of
 her life and what each thing she did was supposed to mean. Brenda was 
perfectly happy with her anonymous life.</p>
